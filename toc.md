Welcome to the 'React for JavaScript Literate' course, a 10-lesson quick course designed to bridge the gap between your current knowledge as a Frontend UI software developer who uses jQuery and JavaScript, and the brave new world of JavaScript Frameworks, specifically React! Throughout this engaging learning experience, I'll guide you through the fundamental concepts and best practices of React, enabling you to transition seamlessly from traditional JavaScript libraries to the modern React ecosystem. From component-based architecture to state management and event handling, you'll gain the expertise required to build robust and dynamic user interfaces. Get ready to unlock the full potential of React and elevate your frontend development capabilities to new heights!

In this course, I am assuming a basic to intermediate level of JavaScript knowledge, omitting unnecessary details that should be familiar to the reader. Here, the focus is on introducing new concepts and techniques specific to React. However, additional reference materials are always included.

By studying React's principles and its role in creating modular and reusable components, learners can better understand how React revolutionizes web development. Here is the table of contents we will be covering over the span of 10 lessons.
