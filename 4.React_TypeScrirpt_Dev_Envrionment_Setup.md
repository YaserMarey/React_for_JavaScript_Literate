# React and TypeScrirpt Devevlopment Envrionment Setup

We will continue using same tools from last chapter, `visual studio code`, `node`, and `npm` when we discussed TypeScript as a programming language. But in order to write a React application we will need to discuss how to bundle the different resources and transpile JSC and TypeScript to JavaScript along with the proper folder structure we need to use.

First let's disucss our build tool: webpack

## Webpack

Webpack is a popular module bundler used in React applications (and many other JavaScript applications) to package and bundle various assets, such as JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, images, and more. Its primary role in React applications is to optimize and prepare the code for deployment by performing several tasks:

- Module Bundling: Webpack analyzes the dependency tree of your application and bundles all the required modules into a single or multiple output files. This reduces the number of HTTP requests made by the browser, improving the application's performance.

- Code Transformation: Webpack can transform code using loaders. Loaders enable you to preprocess different types of files before they are bundled. For example, webpack can use Babel as a loader to transpile modern JavaScript (ES6+) into older versions that are widely supported by browsers.

- Development Server: Webpack includes a built-in development server that allows you to run your React application locally during development. The development server automatically rebuilds and reloads the application whenever changes are made, making the development process more efficient.

- Asset Management: Webpack treats all assets in your application, such as images, fonts, and stylesheets, as modules. It can handle these assets by applying loaders to process and optimize them. For example, webpack can compress images or inline small images as data URLs to reduce network requests.

- Code Splitting: Webpack supports code splitting, which allows you to split your code into smaller chunks. This feature is especially useful for large applications, as it enables lazy loading of modules, reducing the initial load time of the application.

- Environment Configuration: Webpack provides a way to configure different environments, such as development, production, or testing. It allows you to specify environment-specific settings and optimizations, ensuring that your React application performs optimally in each environment.

## Scafolding React App

Open `Visual Studio Code` in the folder where you want the project to be. Run the following command:
``` Shell
npx create-react-app myapp --template typescript
```

`creat-react-app` is a otoo that creates React/TypeScript project, we pass the name of the project as `myapp` and we specified `typescript` as the template should be used.

```Shell
npm start
```

Couple of Visual Stuiod Extensions that would help us writing TypeScript effectivley:
1. ESLint for type checking, install and make sure that typescript and typescriptreact are included in the array of langug ids for which the extension should probe.

2. Prettier for code formatting, install and make sure Format On Save is selected in the workspace settings, and Prettier is selected as the default formatter

In the Explorer panel, create a folder called `src`. The `src` folder will hold all the source code for the app. The project configuration files will be placed at the root of the project.

Next, we will define the critical information about the project in `package.json`

The `package.json` file defines our project name, description, npm scripts, dependent npm modules, and much more.

Create a `package.json` file at the root of the project with the following content:
```JavaScript
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "description": "My React and TypeScript app",
  "version": "0.0.1"
}
```

## Creating our First React App

1. Add `index.html` which is the html page that will host the app. In `src` folder create `index.html` and paste the follwoing:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```
The div element with `id` attribute value of `root` is where our React application will be injected.

2. Install typescript node module
   
```Shell
npm install --save-dev typescript
```
This command does the same as the command we used in last chapter:
```Shell
apt install node-typescript
```
the main differences between `npm install --save-dev typescript` and `apt install node-typescript` are the package manager they are associated with (`npm` vs. `apt`) and the installation scope (project-level vs. system-level). The first command is typically used in JavaScript or Node.js projects managed with npm, while the second command is specific to Debian-based Linux distributions and installs TypeScript globally on the system.

You can now find dependency added to `package.json`
```JavaScript
{
    "name": "tsc-play",
    "scripts": {
        "build": "tsc test.ts"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "typescript": "^5.1.6"
    }
}
```
3. Create a TypeScript configuration file. We are going to configure `Bable` to perform transpilation. Create a file called `tsconfig.json` in the root folder and enter the following content into it:
```JavaScript
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noEmit": true,
    "lib": [
      "dom",
      "dom.iterable",
      "esnext"
    ],
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "jsx": "react",
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```
