# Crash Course in Type Script

Before we continue with React, let's equipe ourselves with some basic but adequate understading of TypeScript, the scripting language we will be using to write React applications.

## TypeScript Basics

TypeScript is a programming language that was first released in 2012 and is still being updated regularly. It’s like an upgraded version of JavaScript, with extra features that make it easier to use. However, TypeScript code can’t be run directly in a web browser like JavaScript can. Instead, it has to be converted into JavaScript first.

TypeScript adds a rich type system to JavaScript. It is generally used with frontend frameworks such as Angular, Vue, and React.

TypeScript adds some extra features to JavaScript, like the ability to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This can help prevent bugs and make your code easier to read and understand.

For example, let's say you have a function that adds two numbers together. In JavaScript, you might write it like this:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

In TypeScript, you can specify the types of the `a` and `b` parameters to make sure they are both numbers:

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

This way, if you accidentally try to call the `add` function with something other than numbers, TypeScript will give you an error and prevent you from making a mistake.

Let's try copying the following code in test.ts file in Visual Studio Code

```TypeScript
function calculateTotalPrice(
  product: { name: string; unitPrice: number },
  quantity: number,
  discount: number
) {
  const priceWithoutDiscount = product.price * quantity;
  const discountAmount = priceWithoutDiscount * discount;
  return priceWithoutDiscount - discountAmount;
}
```
You will see that `price` is underlined in red in Visual Studio Code as it doesn't belong to `proudct` object. This wouldn't be caught by JavaScript until code is run but with TypeScript we can detect it early in the development.

## Basic Types in TypeScript

JavaScript only has a minimal set of types, such as string, number, and boolean. It is worth noting that all of the JavaScript types are available in TypeScript because Typescript is a superset of Javascript.

Also, JavaScript allows a variable to change its type – meaning that the JavaScript engine won’t throw an error if a variable is changed to a completely different type. This loose typing makes it impossible for code editors to catch type errors.

Types in TypeScript allow you to specify the type of data that a variable can hold. This can help prevent bugs and make your code easier to read and understand. Here are some common types in TypeScript and examples of how to use them:

- Boolean: This type represents a value that can be either true or false. For example:
```TypeScript
let isDone: boolean = false;
```

- Number: This type represents a numeric value. For example:
```TypeScript
let decimal: number = 6;
let hex: number = 0xf00d;
let binary: number = 0b1010;
let octal: number = 0o744;
```
- String: This type represents a sequence of characters. For example:
```TypeScript
let color: string = "blue";
color = 'red';
```

- Array: This type represents an ordered list of values. You can specify the type of the values in the array using square brackets [] or the Array type. For example:
```TypeScript
let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let list: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];
```

- Tuple: This type represents an array with a fixed number of elements, where each element can have a different type. For example:
```TypeScript
let x: [string, number];
x = ["hello", 10]; // OK
x = [10, "hello"]; // Error
```

- Enum: This type represents a set of named values. For example:
```TypeScript
enum Color {Red, Green, Blue}
let c: Color = Color.Green;
```

- Any: This type represents any value. It’s useful when you don’t know the type of a value or when you want to allow any type. For example:
```TypeScript
let notSure: any = 4;
notSure = "maybe a string instead";
notSure = false; // okay, definitely a boolean
```

In addition to the basic types I mentioned earlier, TypeScript also has some more advanced types that can be useful in certain situations. Here are a few examples:

- Union Type: This type allows you to specify that a variable can be one of several different types. For example:
```TypeScript
let myVar: string | number;
myVar = "hello"; // OK
myVar = 5; // OK
myVar = true; // Error
```

Intersection Type: This type allows you to combine multiple types into one. For example:
```TypeScript
interface A {
  a: string;
}
interface B {
  b: number;
}
let myVar: A & B = { a: "hello", b: 5 }; // OK
```

Type Aliases: This feature allows you to create a new name for an existing type. For example:
```TypeScript
type MyString = string;
let myVar: MyString = "hello"; // OK
```

Type Assertions: This feature allows you to tell TypeScript that you know the type of a value better than it does. For example:
```TypeScript
let myVar: any = "hello";
let strLength: number = (<string>myVar).length; // OK
```
