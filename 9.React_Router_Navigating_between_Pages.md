# Lesson 9: React Router: Navigating between Pages

## 1. Introduction to React Router:
   - Understanding the importance of routing in single-page applications.
   - Overview of React Router and its role in managing navigation in React applications.
   - Exploring the different components provided by React Router (e.g., `BrowserRouter`, `Switch`, `Route`, `Link`).

## 2. Setting Up React Router:
   - Installing the necessary packages (`react-router-dom`) and integrating React Router into a React project.
   - Configuring the router component (`BrowserRouter`) to enable routing functionality.
   - Setting up basic routes and rendering components based on URL paths using the `Route` component.

## 3. Navigating Between Pages:
   - Utilizing the `Link` component to create navigation links between different pages in the application.
   - Understanding the concept of route parameters and dynamic routing.
   - Implementing programmatic navigation using the `history` object or hooks (`useHistory`, `useLocation`, `useParams`) provided by React Router.
