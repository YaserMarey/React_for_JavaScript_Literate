# More on Sate in React and Events

In this chapter we will continue discussing `state` in React. We will start by implementing visible state in the `Alert` component we built in chapter 2.

The visible state will allow the user to close the `Alert` component. Follow these steps:
1. In `alert.js` add 
```JavaScript
import { useState } from 'react';
```
2. Define the `visible` state as follows:
```JavaScript
export funtion Alert(...){
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(true)
  if (!visible){
    return null;
  }
  return(
    ...
  );
}
```
3. Add a close button to the `Alert` component so that the component becomes as the following:
```JavaScript
import {useState} from 'react'
export function Alert({type="information", 
heading, 
children, 
closable}) {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(true);
  if (!visible){
    return null;
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <span
          role="img"
          aria-label={type === "warning" ? "Warning": "Information"}>
          {type === "warning" ? "⚠" : "ℹ"}
        </span>
        <span>{heading}</span>
        <button aria-label="Close">
          <span role="img" aria-label="Close">X</span>
        </button>
      </div>
      <div>{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
4. We would like to render the close button only if `closable` property is `true`, we can do that with a trick using `&&`. We logically And Closable to the button tag which means that if `closable` is not true it will shortcircuit and won't render the button. The following is the code snipet:
```JavaScript
...
{closable && (
        <button aria-label="Close">
          <span role="img" aria-label="Close">
            X
          </span>
        </button>
...
```
5. Now we pass `closable` to the `Alert` from `App` component.

```JavaScript
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Alert type="information" heading="Success"  closable>
        Everything is really good!
      </Alert>
    </div>
  );
}
```
***Notice*** that we don't need to state closable={true} since true here is assumed by default.
6. 

Here's an example that demonstrates state usage in a simple counter component:

```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  increment() {
    this.setState((prevState) => ({
      count: prevState.count + 1
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.increment()}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In this example, the `Counter` component has an initial state of `count: 0`. The `increment()` method uses `this.setState()` to update the state by incrementing the `count` value. By calling `setState()`, React intelligently updates the component and triggers a re-render, resulting in the updated count being displayed.

## 3 - Immutable State and Immutability Concepts

Imagine your React state as a precious gemstone locked inside a glass case. Immutable state means that the gemstone cannot be directly altered or modified once it's inside the case. Instead, you must create a new gemstone with the desired changes and replace the existing one.

In React, immutability refers to the practice of not modifying the state directly. Instead, you create a new copy of the state with the desired changes. This ensures that the original state remains unchanged and helps prevent unintended side effects.

Immutable state is particularly important when working with complex data structures or when optimizing performance. By keeping the state immutable, React can efficiently compare the old and new state to determine what needs to be updated in the user interface.

Here's an example that demonstrates immutability in React:

```jsx
class TodoList extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      todos: ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3']
    };
  }

  addTodo() {
    const newTodo = 'Task 4';
    this.setState((prevState) => ({
      todos: [...prevState.todos, newTodo]
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <ul>
          {this.state.todos.map((todo, index) => (
            <li key={index}>{todo}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
        <button onClick={() => this.addTodo()}>Add Todo</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<TodoList />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In this example, the `TodoList` component maintains an array of todos in its state. When the button is clicked, the `addTodo()` method is called. Instead of modifying the existing `todos` array directly, a new array is created using the spread operator `[...prevState.todos]`, and the new todo is added to it. This ensures that the original `todos` array remains unchanged.

Understanding immutable state and the concept of immutability is crucial for writing efficient and predictable React applications. By embracing immutability, you can avoid common pitfalls and build more reliable and maintainable code.

## 4-  Props in React

Think of props in React as messages passed from a sender to a receiver, like a note handed from one person to another. Props allow components to communicate and share data with each other, enabling a seamless flow of information within your React application.

In React, props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to its child components. They are immutable and provide a way to configure and customize child components based on the parent's requirements.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of props:

```jsx
// Parent Component
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Welcome name="John" />;
  }
}

// Child Component
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Greeting />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In this example, the parent component `Greeting` passes the prop `name` with the value `"John"` to the child component `Welcome`. The child component receives the prop through `this.props.name` and uses it to customize the rendered output. In this case, it displays the greeting message "Hello, John!".

Props can be used to pass various types of data, such as strings, numbers, booleans, or even functions, from parent components to child components. They provide a way to configure and personalize child components based on the needs of the parent component.

## 5- Passing Props and Prop Validation

Imagine a delivery person carrying a package from one place to another. Props in React work in a similar way, acting as carriers of data from a sender (parent component) to a recipient (child component). However, it's important to ensure that the package being delivered is valid and meets certain criteria.

In React, passing props involves providing values or data from a parent component to its child components. This allows child components to access and utilize the passed data. It's like passing a baton in a relay race, ensuring a smooth transfer of information between components.

Prop validation is the process of defining the expected types and requirements for the props being passed to a component. It's like having specific instructions for the delivery person to ensure that the package being delivered meets certain standards.

Here's an example that demonstrates passing props and prop validation:

```jsx
// Parent Component
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Welcome name="John" age={25} />;
  }
}

// Child Component
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>
        <p>Age: {this.props.age}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

Welcome.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  age: PropTypes.number.isRequired
};

ReactDOM.render(<Greeting />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In this example, the parent component `Greeting` passes the props `name` and `age` to the child component `Welcome`. The child component receives and displays these props. Additionally, prop validation is implemented using `PropTypes` to specify that `name` should be a string and `age` should be a number. The `isRequired` flag ensures that these props are mandatory.

Passing props and implementing prop validation in React enhances the reliability and maintainability of your code. It helps ensure that the data being passed between components is of the expected type and meets the necessary requirements.

# Component Lifecycle

In React components, lifecycle methods provide hooks into different stages of a component's existence. They enable developers to perform actions at specific points in a component's lifecycle, such as initialization, rendering, and destruction.

Here are a few commonly used lifecycle methods in React:

- `componentDidMount()`: This method is called immediately after the component is mounted (i.e., inserted into the DOM). It's often used for initial setup, such as fetching data from an API.

- `componentDidUpdate()`: This method is called after a component is updated

 (i.e., after props or state changes). It can be used to perform additional logic or side effects based on the changes.

- `componentWillUnmount()`: This method is called right before a component is unmounted (i.e., removed from the DOM). It allows for cleanup tasks, such as removing event listeners or canceling subscriptions.

Here's an example showcasing the usage of these lifecycle methods:

```jsx
class Timer extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { seconds: 0 };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    if (this.state.seconds >= 60) {
      clearInterval(this.timerID);
    }
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState((prevState) => ({ seconds: prevState.seconds + 1 }));
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Seconds: {this.state.seconds}</div>;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Timer` component uses the `componentDidMount()` method to start a timer when the component is mounted. The `componentDidUpdate()` method is used to stop the timer if the seconds reach or exceed 60. Finally, the `componentWillUnmount()` method is used to clean up the timer before the component is unmounted.

Understanding and utilizing lifecycle methods in React allows developers to control and manage the behavior of components throughout their lifecycle. By tapping into these methods, developers can initialize, update, and clean up resources as needed, ensuring smooth and efficient component interactions.
